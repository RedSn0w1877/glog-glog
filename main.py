# formula for co2: ΔT=λ⋅ln(C/​C0​)
# the triangleT thing is like how mmuch is change
# the half life logo means climate sensitivity, it's like 2.5-4.5 degrees celcious (we in 'MERICA why we using mmetric)
# the C is co2 concentraion in parts per million
# the c with a 0 is pre-industrial co2 in ppm like 280ppm
# bruh more math
# ok so time for kg -> ppm 
# Δppm= M*10^-12/(mGt)(f)
# where triangle ppm is the answer
# m is the mass of the co2 added in kilograms
# mGt is the mass of the atmosphere 5.15*10^6 gigatones, aka 515000000000000000 kilograms
# and f is the fraction of co2
# screw lines 8-12 just know that 7810000000000 kg of co2 gets u 1ppm
 # a ppm is like a part per million
